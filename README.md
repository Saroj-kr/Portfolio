Thank you for visiting my profile.

Below I have listed few of the competitions i have participated in along with the summary and score.
For more detail on the analysis and prediction models that i used, you can view the Python notebook links for the respective Competition<sup>**</sup>.  

Alternatively you can visit my profile for the updated scores, by using the below links
* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sarojkr)
* [DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org/users/Saroj)

Most of the Notebooks use the basic python libraries mentioned below:
* matplotlib
* numpy
* pandas
* seaborn
* sklearn

## Competitions Participated 
###### The summary for the competition is shamelessly copied from the website's summary.

* **Driven Data** :
  1. **Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table**:  
  **Summary**:  
  The goal in this Competition was to predict operating condition of a waterpoint for each record in the dataset.   
  It was a supervised classification problem with 3 target labels.   
  The training data set comprised of both numerical and categorical data. I've used sklearn libraries for creating the model and GridSearchCV for hypertuning the parameters  
  **Best score**: 0.8074  
  **Current Rank**: 1332  
  **Python Notebook**: Cannot share the code currently as the competition is still in progress  
  1. **BoxPlot for Education**:  
  **Summary**:  
  The goal for this Competition was to predict how schools are spending money and tailor their strategy recommendations to improve outcomes for students, teachers, and administrators.  
  This was a multi-class-multi-label supervised classification problem, with 10 target labels and more than a 100 sub target labels.   
  **Best score**: 2.8637  
  **Current Rank**: 127  
  **Python Notebook**: Cannot share the code currently as the competition is still in progress  
  1. **DengAI: Predicting Disease Spread**:
  **Summary**:  
  The goal for this Competition was to predict the spread of Dengue disease on the basis of environmental and climatic situations.  
  This is a supervised regression problem.  
  **Best score**: 26.9736  
  **Current Rank**: 2159  
  **Python Notebook**: Cannot share the code currently as the competition is still in progress  
* **Kaggle**
  1. **Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster**:  
   **Summary**:  
   The goal here was to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).   
   It is a binary supervised classification problem with numerical, categorical as well as as text data.   
   **Best score**: 0.789  
   **Current Rank**: 3580
