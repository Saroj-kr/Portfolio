Below I have listed few of the competitions i have participated in along with the summary and score.
For more detail on the analysis and prediction models that i used, you can view the Python notebook links for the respective Competition.

Most of the Notebooks use the basic libraries
* matplotlib
* numpy
* pandas
* seaborn
* sklearn

If you don't want to install any of this, you may launch the repository using [binder](https://mybinder.org/) link present at the top of page.

## Competitions Participated 
###### The summary for the competition is shamelessly copied from the website's summary.

* **Driven Data** :
  1. **Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table**:  
  **Summary**:  
  The goal in this Competition was to predict operating condition of a waterpoint for each record in the dataset.   
  It was a supervised classification problem with 3 target labels.   
  The training data set comprised of both numerical and categorical data. I've used sklearn libraries for creating the model and GridSearchCV for hypertuning the parameters  
  **Best score**: 0.8074  
  **Current Rank**: 1332

  1. **BoxPlot for Education**:  
  **Summary**:  
  The goal for this Competition was to predict how schools are spending money and tailor their strategy recommendations to improve outcomes for students, teachers, and administrators.  
  This was a multi-class-multi-label supervised classification problem, with 10 target labels and more than a 100 sub target labels.   
  **Best score**: 2.8637  
  **Current Rank**: 127

* **Kaggle**
  1. **Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster**:  
   **Summary**:  
   The goal here was to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).   
   It is a binary supervised classification problem with numerical, categorical as well as as text data.   
   **Best score**: 0.789  
   **Current Rank**: 3580
